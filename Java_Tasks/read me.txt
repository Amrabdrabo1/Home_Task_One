In java_tasks, The task_one is the problem one of the first hometask 1: 

Input Values:

The code is designed to use the Earth's diameter and the Sun's diameter as input.
You can change these values in the main method of the code by modifying the variables Sun_Diameter and Earth_Diameter.

Observe Output:

The code will calculate the volumes of the Earth and the Sun and the ratio between them.
It will print the results to the console.

Review Results:

The code will display the volume of the Earth, the volume of the Sun, and the ratio of the Sun's volume to the Earth's volume.







In java_tasks, The task_two is the problem one of the first hometask 2: 

This Java program, Task_two, is designed to find and print prime numbers within a specified range. The program defines a range of values (from 2 to nValues) and then iterates through the values, checking if each value is prime. If a value is prime, it is printed to the console. 

Input: The program uses a constant value nValues set to 50, which defines the range of values to check for prime numbers. You can modify the nValues variable in the code to specify a different range if needed.

Output: When you run the program, it will print prime numbers within the specified range to the console.








In java_tasks, The task_Three is the problem one of the first hometask 3: 

This Java program, Task_three, is designed to analyze a given text and count the number of vowels, consonants, and spaces in the text. It processes the input text and provides a summary of these counts.

Input: The program comes with a predefined input text. You can modify the text variable in the code to analyze different text inputs.

Output: When you run the program, it will process the input text and display the counts of vowels, consonants, and spaces in the text.







In java_tasks, The task_Four is the problem four of the first hometask 4: 

Input: The program uses a predefined input string S. You can modify the S variable in the code to analyze different input strings.

Output: When you run the program, it will split the input string into words, sort them alphabetically, and display the sorted list of words.
